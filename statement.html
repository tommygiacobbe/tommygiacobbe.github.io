            <h5>artist's statement</h5>
            <p>This project was a very free form exploration of web design, coding, story telling and imbuing a
                narrative into a product. The main themes revolve around; the origins of the internet and associated
                community, the impact of copyright with media, and lastly the more recent issues surrounding AI art
                theft, along with what some people are doing about it.
                The aim was to draw a through line and create a narrative with this idea, being the effects of community
                and accessibility in online and media-creating spaces. The actual motif of the project was more
                lighthearted, taking inspiration from older RPG games, both table-top and digital. The goal was to have
                a more fantastical feeling to the narrative almost to a satirical degree by playing with fantasy tropes,
                yet also trying to maintain a more mysterious tone in the content to better bridge the gap with the
                concepts that are relevant to our world today.
