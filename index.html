This would bring about huge change, but the potential gain in terms of being able to pull people together and allow them to be able to communicate on the same level with such ease is incredible. Some of the council fears that there is too much potential to bring more harm than good. As for myself, the thought of having everyone being able to access the magical information is thrilling, imagine all the good that could be had with everyone having access to such a web of potential. There are some risks of course, but many of us think that there is much good that can come of this. Yes, there are some dark possbilities that can arise when I think on it, but I will choose to believe in the spirit of community this will be founded upon.</p>
