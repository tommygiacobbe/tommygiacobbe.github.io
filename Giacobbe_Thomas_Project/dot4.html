      <p>Regardless of all the debate, it was agreed that a certain number of spells would be assigned this key. Certain spells could be registered and they would contain a unique sigil that would identify its creator and prevent usage by those unauthorized. With time I came to see some of my fears come to light. Although this key became important to protect people, it was equally used by certain groups of individuals to gain profit and control. It has only gone further with time, few people holding many and most of the keys, relentlessly protecting them from any who wish to create a similar magic. It remains to be seen how this will progress, and what potential for good these keys may have to protect the personal creations of all people.</p>
