            <p class="lefty">It's been long since the initial implementation of the keys, and throughout the rise of their use for selfish and misguided reasons, their place of importance has been questioned as much as its been reinforced. What's complicated matters is the creation of a new type of special magical artifacts, those with a level of sentience. Their nature has been a subject of much debate, whether enchanted or cursed or otherwise, but truly I've begun to believe that in their lack of innate morality the only deciding factor is the user, and the choices they make. But enough of that for now. A current concern has been their use in the theft of the creations of others, regardless of keys, whether respectfully earned and maintened or not. This has reinforced the importance of keys in some and a desire to push them to an even higher level of prevelance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-focus-in linebox">
            <p class="righty"> And sometimes I find myself agreeing, the keys earned and maintained by incredible crafters should be protected, although I hope this does not give even greater power to their exploiters. What's truly sparked a nostalgic hope in me is the work of talented groups of mages; creating veils, nets and barriers to shroud and protect the creations of others from this theft. These barriers are being shared at no cost and made readily availble to those who need them, there really seems to be a growing feeling of connection and community.</p>
