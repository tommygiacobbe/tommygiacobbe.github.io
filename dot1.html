      <p>A disastrous start to the council meeting. They were firm in there assertion that magic could not be released uncontrolled, and that it needed to be structured. There were several proposals, but one which was much discussed was the addition of a key of ownership; binding the spell to its creator in the hopes that untoward modification could be prevented. That was the first idea that everyone seemed to be willing to accept, it had been done on a smaller scale before with some success. It came to be greatly protested that this would eventually lead to some individuals controlling large swaths of magic and could end in those few being able to demand payment for the use of the spell that they had created. This was a direct contradiction to what this was all for. The needs of the greater community should outweigh the needs of the people who are scared or are trying to profit from this.</p>
